Title: Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection in 5G Traffic
Introduction

With the rapid adoption of 5G networks, the volume, variety, and velocity of network traffic have increased significantly. While 5G brings ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and high throughput, it also introduces new vulnerabilities and complex traffic patterns. Traditional anomaly detection methods relying on labeled datasets are often inadequate due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled data and the evolving nature of cyber threats.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) emerges as a powerful paradigm, leveraging large amounts of unlabeled traffic data to learn meaningful representations, which can then be used for robust anomaly detection without the need for exhaustive labeling.

Problem Statement

The detection of anomalies in 5G traffic is challenging due to:

High traffic complexity – diverse devices, protocols, and dynamic usage.

Data scarcity – limited availability of labeled anomalous data.

Evolving threats – new attack patterns that cannot be captured by static, rule-based systems.

This project focuses on designing a self-supervised anomaly detection model for 5G traffic that can automatically learn representations from raw unlabeled data and accurately identify deviations that may indicate malicious activities, misconfigurations, or abnormal usage patterns.

Objectives

To study 5G traffic characteristics and their anomaly patterns.

To design a self-supervised learning framework that can pre-train on unlabeled data.

To implement an anomaly detection pipeline using learned representations.

To evaluate the model on benchmark 5G traffic datasets with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Methodology

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Gather 5G traffic datasets (e.g., packet-level or flow-level).

Perform feature extraction (packet size, duration, protocol usage, flow statistics).

Normalize and clean the dataset.

Self-Supervised Pretext Task Design

Define tasks such as masking, contrastive learning, or sequence prediction to learn traffic embeddings without labels.

Model Development

Train a deep learning model (e.g., Transformer, Graph Neural Network, or Autoencoder) on pretext tasks.

Fine-tune the model for anomaly detection.

Evaluation

Compare with baseline supervised and unsupervised approaches.

Use detection metrics to validate model effectiveness.

Expected Outcomes

A self-supervised model capable of learning generalizable features from 5G traffic.

Improved anomaly detection performance compared to traditional supervised/unsupervised techniques.

A scalable and adaptable framework for future 6G networks.

Applications

Telecom security monitoring – detection of network intrusions and DDoS attacks.

Quality of Service (QoS) assurance – identification of abnormal traffic affecting performance.

Fraud detection – spotting unusual billing or usage patterns.

Autonomous network management – enabling self-healing and adaptive security in 5G/6G.
